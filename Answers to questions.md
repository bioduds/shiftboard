## Answers

1. **How much time did you spend on the coding test? What would you have improved, or done differently, if you had more time?**

   I spent approximately 10 hours on the coding test. If I had more time, I would have focused on the following improvements:

   - **Enhanced Validation:** Strengthen input validation to handle edge cases more effectively and ensure data integrity.
   
   - **Optimizing Graph Structure:** While the implemented graph structure is a powerful tool for scalability, I would explore further optimizations to enhance performance, especially with larger datasets.

   - **User-Friendly Feedback:** Implement clearer and more user-friendly feedback mechanisms, such as notifications or alerts, to guide users through the application.

   - **Unit Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.

   - **Integration Testing:** .The graph solution implemented here showcases its power in handling complex relationships. In a production environment, considering the potential increase in data volume, the application could benefit from transitioning to a graph database solution such as Amazon Neptune or Neo4j. This shift would enhance performance and scalability, especially when dealing with extensive and interconnected datasets.


2. **What changes would you make to the application to increase its overall performance?**

   - **Caching Mechanism:** Implement a caching mechanism to store and retrieve frequently accessed data, reducing the need for redundant calculations.

   - **Lazy Loading:** Employ lazy loading techniques to load data on-demand, enhancing the initial loading time of the application.

   - **Server-Side Optimization:** Optimize backend processes to handle requests more efficiently, utilizing techniques like query optimization and indexing.

   - **Parallel Processing:** Explore opportunities for parallel processing, especially in scenarios like weight calculation, to distribute the workload and improve execution speed.

3. **What did you think of the code test? How could we improve the test?**

   I found the code test to be challenging and engaging. It provided an opportunity to showcase various skills, including data structuring, algorithm design, and frontend visualization. To further improve the test:

   - **Scalability Challenge:** Consider adding a specific challenge related to handling a much larger dataset, encouraging candidates to explore optimization techniques.

   - **Real-Time Interaction:** Incorporate a real-time interaction element, such as live updates or user-driven actions, to assess candidates' ability to handle dynamic scenarios.

   - **Additional Technologies:** Introduce a requirement to use a specific technology or library not covered in the initial instructions, simulating real-world scenarios where adaptability is crucial.

4. **What is your favourite superpower?**

   My favorite superpower is cleverness (which I personally see as standing between intelligence and smartness). The ability to analyze situations critically, solve complex problems, and adapt to any problem no matter how difficult it seems (think Batman vs. Superman! Cleverness has the ability to beat anything in theory and that's what Batman used to beat the man of steel). Intelligence enables one to navigate challenges efficiently and contribute meaningfully to various endeavors. After all, a clever mind can outsmart even the most formidable opponents, I believe!
